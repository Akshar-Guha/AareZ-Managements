## Environment Variables Requirements

When working with environment variables, always ensure:

1. **JWT_SECRET Configuration**
   - JWT_SECRET must be set in Vercel environment variables
   - Value should remain unchanged once configured
   - Never modify existing JWT_SECRET in production

2. **Database Configuration** 
   - DATABASE_URL must be correctly configured and accessible
   - Verify connection string format before deployment
   - Test database connectivity in development environment

3. **CORS Configuration**
   - CORS_ORIGIN must be set to: `https://aarez-mgnmt.vercel.app`
   - Ensure no trailing slashes or additional protocols
   - Verify domain matches exactly for production deployment

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] JWT_SECRET exists in Vercel environment variables
- [ ] DATABASE_URL connection string is valid
- [ ] CORS_ORIGIN matches: https://aarez-mgnmt.vercel.app
- [ ] All environment variables are properly escaped
- [ ] Production and development environments are configured separately

Always double-check these configurations before deploying to prevent authentication and connectivity issues.
